- Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources
     in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.
- Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). 
- Terraform generates a plan and prompts you for your approval before modifying your infrastructure. 
- It also keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which acts as a source of truth for your environment. 
- The core Terraform workflow consists of three stages:
    - Write: You define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services. 
        For example, you might create a configuration to deploy an application on virtual machines
             in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with security groups and a load balancer.
    - Plan: Terraform creates an execution plan describing the infrastructure it will create, update, or destroy 
        based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration.
    - Apply: On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order, respecting any resource dependencies. 
        For example, if you update the properties of a VPC and change the number of virtual machines in that VPC,
             Terraform will recreate the VPC before scaling the virtual machines.
