- Components
    S3 Objects
        Objects contain data i.e, are resources that represent data and is not infrastructure
        Objects may be of Key(name of the Object), Value(data in sequence of bytes)
      In side Contents: 
        Version Id - have multiple versions of a data file
        Tag - benefits resource tagging but at the object level
        locking - makes data files immutable
        Metadata - attach data alongside the content, to describe the contents of the data
        Etag - a way to detect when the contents of an object has changed without download the contents
            : An entity tag is a response header repesents a hash of the object's contents
            : reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata
            : represents a specific version of an object
            : value is generally represented by a hashing function eg. MDS or SHA-1
            : part of HTTP protocol
            : used for revalidation for caching systems
            : useful if you want to programmatically detect content changes to S3 objects
            : used to track changes
            : determines content is changed 
        Checksums - ensures the integrity of a file being uploaded or downloaded.
            : check the sum (amount) of data to ensure the data integrity of a file.
            : if data is download and if in-transit data is lost or mandled, the Checksum will
                determine there is something wrong with the file.
            : S3 offered Checksum algorithm
                - CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
                - CRC32C 
                - SHA1 (Secure Hash algorithm)
                - SHA256     
        Prefix - simulates file-system folders in a flat hierarchy
    S3 Buckets
        Holds Objects
        can also have folders which in turn hold Objects
        S3 is a universal namespace so bucket names must be unique

- Bucket Types
   General Purpose Buckets
      : Organizes data in a Flat Hierarchy
      : original S3 ucket type (defalut)
      : used with all storage classes except S3 Express One Zone
      : defalut limit of 100 general buckets per account
      : recommendaed for most use cases
   Directory Buckets
      : Organizes data Folder Hierarchy
      : used with only one storage class - S3 Express One Zone
      : defalut limit of 10 directory buckets per account
      : recommended when you need single-digit millisecond performance on PUT and GET
      : Individual directories can scale horizontally

- Bucket folder: 
      : S3 console allows you to "create folders" but S3 - General Purpose Buckets do not have true folders found in file hierarchy 
      i.e, An object in a folder will have a prefix to represent the folder.
      : S3 creates a zero-byte S3 object withh a name that ends in forward slash eg: myfolder/
      : are not their own independent identities but just S3 Objects
      : don't include metadat, permission
      : don't contain anything, they can't be full or empty
      : aren't "moved", S3 objects containing the same prefix are renamed

- Capacity: 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size

- Pricing: [https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4]
    With S3, there are no minimum fees. You only pay for what you use. Prices are based on the location of your S3 bucket.
- Rating: The rate you’re charged depends on 
    your objects' size, 
    the ingest or transition cost or Retrieval fees-
        There are per-request ingest charges when using PUT, COPY, or lifecycle rules to move data into any S3 storage class, 
    how long you stored the objects during the month, and 
    the storage class— at object level
        S3 Express One Zone
            : Single-digit millisecond response times for the most frequently accessed data.
            : Directory bucket type
        S3 Standard
            : Frequently accessed data (more than once a month) with milliseconds access
        S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            : Data with changing or unknown access patterns
            : pay a monthly monitoring and automation charge per object stored to monitor access patterns and move objects between access tiers. 
            : there are no retrieval charges, and no additional tiering charges apply when objects are moved between access tiers
        S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
            : Infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access
            : min storgae duration - 30 days
            : Min billable object size - 128 KB
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
        S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
            : Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) stored in a single Availability Zone with milliseconds access
            : min storgae duration - 30 days
            : Min billable object size - 128 KB
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
        S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
            : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds
            : min storgae duration - 90 days
            : Min billable object size - 128 KB
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
        S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier)
            : Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours
            : min storgae duration - 90 days
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
        S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            : Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours
            : min storgae duration - 180 days
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
        Reduced redundancy
            : Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milliseconds access (not recommended as S3 Standard is more cost effective)
            : Retrieval fees - Per-GB fees apply
