AWS CloudFormation Serverless Application Model (SAM)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html

- You create templates to describe your AWS resources and their properties. 
- Whenever you create a stack, CloudFormation provisions the resources that are described in your template.
- template.yaml : CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources. 
- When you use CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack.
- All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template.
- Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.

- CloudFormation can only perform actions that you have permission to do.
- You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage permissions.
- CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.
